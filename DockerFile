# Step 1: Use the official .NET SDK image to build the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project file and restore any dependencies (via dotnet restore)
COPY ["JobHunterApi/JobHunterApi.csproj", "JobHunterApi/"]

# Restore dependencies
RUN dotnet restore "JobHunterApi/JobHunterApi.csproj"

# Copy the entire project and build it
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build "JobHunterApi/JobHunterApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

# Step 2: Publish the app to /app/publish directory
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "JobHunterApi/JobHunterApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

# Step 3: Use the runtime image to run the app
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS final

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the published files from the previous image
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .

# Expose port 80 for the API
EXPOSE 80

# Set the entry point to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "JobHunterApi.dll"]
